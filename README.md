# CRUD-Go
Simple CRUD using Golang, Gin and GROM

## Dynamic Model - Simply update the struct
It has AutoMigrate enabled in the main function which allows the model struct to me changed as needed during development phases.

## Simplified route handling with Gin
Previously I worked with gorilla and negroni for my web handling. I stumble across Gin and didn't want yet another new framework but it turned out to be just what I needed here. It's straightforward and simple with some built in features ideal for API work
